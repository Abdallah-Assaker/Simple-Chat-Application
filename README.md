# Simple-Chat-Application
Chat Client-Server: Simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and send public or private messages.

This is a test project for a simple chat application built using C# and Windows Forms. The application consists of a server and multiple clients that communicate over a network.

The server app has a start connection button that opens a connection and allows clients to connect. It also has a remove client button to disconnect a specific client and a close server button to stop the server. Additionally, the server app displays all connected clients in a list view along with their names.

The client app is built using Windows Forms and allows users to connect to the server, write messages, and send both public and private messages to other clients. It has a connect button, a text box for writing messages, a send button, and a text box for displaying incoming and outgoing messages. A drop-list also displays all connected clients and enables the user to send private messages to a specific client.

Please note that this project is still in its testing phase and may require further adjustments and improvements. The purpose of this project is to provide a basic framework for a simple chat application, but it should not be considered production-ready.
